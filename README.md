Atomise
==========

Frontend tool for building your website/webapp with atomic design in mind.

### Gruntfiles
There are two grunt files, one to build your app/website (**GruntFile.js**), the other to customize the Atomise App (**GruntFileDev.js**).
By default, this is the GruntFile.js that is lunched with `grunt` command. To lunch the second grunt file use : `grunt --gruntfile GruntFileDev.js`.
